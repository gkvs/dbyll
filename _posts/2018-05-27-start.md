Start of the project GKVS.

GKVS is the Generic Key Value Store (or Service). It can operate own tables or federated ones.
It will support most popular and fast key-value storage systems for federated tables. 
The first pilot backing storage is Aerospike.

GKVS will have in-memory cache and automatic load-balancer.

For the local flash storage GKVS will probably use RocksDB.
